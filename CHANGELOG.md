# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork. The history of the original project (voidput/SCMCP, up to 1.5.0) is kept in
[docs/UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md](docs/UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md). Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **`provenance.data_age` is now the age of the data itself**, from dates the source gives (UEX `date_modified` of the
  rows returned, the SCMDB channel's `generated_at`); `null` with `data_age_note` when the source gives none. The old
  meaning (age of the fetch or cache) is the new `provenance.cache_age`, also used by `sc_data_status`.
- `uex_get_commodity_prices` answers `buy_locations` and `sell_locations` (cheapest / best first, `limit` default 15,
  max 50, with totals; `side` keeps one), leaves out rows of an older game version than LIVE and counts them
  (`excluded_older_version`, `include_older_versions` to keep them), and adds `updated_at` to each row.
- `uex_get_trade_routes` ranks routes with a UEX estimate (`is_estimate`, 0 reports at an end) after reported ones;
  new `min_reports` drops them. Routes and ship prices carry `updated_at` when UEX dates them.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-11-03

First release of the fork. Licence treated as GPLv3 (see THIRD_PARTY.md).

### Added
- **Provenance on every answer** (`source`, `channel`, `game_version`, `fetched_at`, `data_age`, `kind`, `trust`,
  `stale`) and `sc_data_status`, which shows each source's version, age, disagreements and outages.
- **SCMDB tools**: `scmdb_search_missions`, `scmdb_search_crafting`, `scmdb_search_mining`, `scmdb_changes`.
- **Game log tools** (off by default, read-only): `sc_log_status`, `sc_log_recent_events`, `sc_log_context`,
  `sc_log_sessions`; events verified on real logs across patches 4.0 to 4.10.
- **Fleet**: `sc_fleet_get`, `sc_fleet_upsert`, `sc_fleet_remove` on a local file; names matched by words with
  candidates when ambiguous.
- **`sc_patch_notes`**: the notes of an update from starcitizen.tools, by section or keyword. No RSI scraping.
- **Ship-sized trade routes** (`ship_name`), profit for the cargo that fits, player reports behind each price.
- **MCP prompts**: `haul_plan`, `patch_briefing`, `session_debrief`, `mining_prep`, `mission_hunt`.
- **Tool profiles** (`SCMCP_PROFILES`: core, trade, data, local) and explicit scoping (`SCMCP_TOOLS`).
- **Resilience**: retries on transient failures, rate limiting under each source's limit, disk cache served (flagged
  stale) only when a source is unreachable.
- **Tooling**: `npm run doctor`, `npm run check:sources`, `npm run install:claude` (minimal, backed-up merge of the
  Claude Desktop config), generated `docs/TOOLS.md`, `npm run golden:update`.
- Documentation, security model, third-party licence table, contribution guides, issue and PR templates, CI
  (lint, format, types, tests on Linux and Windows, production audit, signatures) and CodeQL.

### Changed
- Source split into `core`, `providers` and `tools`; every outbound request goes through a host-allowlisted client
  that attaches the UEX token only to UEX hosts and checks redirects.
- Default UEX host is the documented `api.uexcorp.uk`.
- Cache, snapshot and config folders are per-user instead of the working directory; the GitHub token is the
  dedicated `SCMCP_GITHUB_TOKEN`; `.env` is read from the package folder only.
- Descriptions of the tools rewritten for model selection.

### Fixed
- `uex_get_trade_routes` always failed (UEX requires an origin) and its profit was UEX's figure for the route's
  maximum volume (for example 100,000 SCU), not the player's cargo.
- `scw_get_vehicle`, `scw_get_item` and `scw_get_ship_comparison` returned "Result too large" for most ships.
- Dataset names with `:` (Windows drive letters, alternate data streams) are refused.
- Repository names accepted `../x`; a dump commit id is validated before it enters a path.

### Removed
- Docker image publishing, semantic-release, `Dockerfile`, `install.sh`, `Makefile` (nothing is published).

### Security
- 0 advisories (production and development), CodeQL on every push, secret scanning and push protection enabled.
